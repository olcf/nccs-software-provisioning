NCCS Software Provisioning (NSP)
--------------------------------

The National Center for Computational Sciences (NCCS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory has developed NCCS Software
Provisioning (NSP), a unified framework for deploying software stacks and monitoring their usage on HPC systems.
NSP leverages Ansible to automate the deployment of Spack environments using templates and to manage installation
procedures for non-Spack software through custom roles. Additionally, NSP enhances vendor-managed LMOD installations
using hooks, enabling dynamic and responsive software layouts that adapt seamlessly to changes in the programming
environment.
