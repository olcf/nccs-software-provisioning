                    - modules
                    - packages

          For each environment you should create a directory with the same name in the playbook directory under
          ``spack/environments``.

          ``spack_version`` should reference a spack version defined in
          :ref:`NSP_SPACK_versions_variable`.

          For each environment this role will automatically clone one Spack package repo as defined in
          :ref:`NSP_SPACK_package_repo_variable`. You can use this repo in your template files using the
          variable ``_SPACK_environment_package_repo_path``. To set the git reference of the package repo
          for an environment set the ``packages_git_reference`` option. To set an optional patch file
          set ``packages_patch``.

          We like to split our spack configuration for each environment into multiple files. ``specific_templates``
          are templates that are specific to each environment. They should be placed under
          ``spack/environments/<environment_name>`` in your playbook directory. ``shared_templates`` are used by all
          of the environments and should be placed under ``spack/environments``.
