                example_env:
                  spack_version: v0.23.1
                  extensions:
                    - spack-olcf
                  specific_templates:
                    - packages
                  shared_templates:
                    - mirrors

          For each environment you should create a directory with the same name in the playbook directory under
          ``spack/environments``.

          ``spack_version`` should reference a spack version defined in
          :ref:`NSP_SPACK_versions_variable` and ``extensions`` should be a list of extensions that can be found
          in the playbook directory under ``spack/extensions``.

          We like to split our spack configuration for each environment into multiple files. ``specific_templates``
          are templates that are specific to each environment. They should be places under
          ``spack/environments/<environment_name>``. ``shared_templates`` are used by all of the environments and should
          be placed under ``spack/environments``. There is a third catagory of templates that should not go into your
          configuration but is important to know about. We call them ``nsp_templates`` these are templates that are
          shared by all environments but instead of being in your playbook directory they are provided by the spack role
          itself.
