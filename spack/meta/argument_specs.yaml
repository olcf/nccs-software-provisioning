                example_env:
                  spack_version: v0.23.1
                  specific_templates:
                    - spack
                  shared_templates:
                    - bootstrap
                    - compilers
                    - concretizer
                    - config
                    - mirrors
                    - modules
                    - packages

          For each environment you should create a directory with the same name in the playbook directory under
          ``spack/environments``.

          ``spack_version`` should reference a spack version defined in
          :ref:`NSP_SPACK_versions_variable`.

          We like to split our spack configuration for each environment into multiple files. ``specific_templates``
          are templates that are specific to each environment. They should be placed under
          ``spack/environments/<environment_name>`` in your playbook directory. ``shared_templates`` are used by all
          of the environments and should be placed under ``spack/environments``.
